# Sponsorship & Public Value

This repository is supported through GitHub Sponsors to sustain the public
development of **audit-ready cloud risk decision frameworks**.

## What sponsorship supports

* Cloud security risk decision models
* Governance and audit traceability structures
* Vendor-neutral, compliance-safe documentation
* Public decision artifacts used in reviews and interviews

## What sponsors do NOT receive

* No private consulting
* No privileged access
* No influence over conclusions

All material remains public, abstracted, and safe for professional sharing.
