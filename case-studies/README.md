# Case Studies

This directory contains **abstracted cloud risk decision examples**.

They are not tutorials and do not represent production systems.

Each case study follows the same decision structure used in the
`decision-model` to demonstrate how reasoning, trade-offs, and
audit traceability are documented.

The objective is to model **decision quality**, not implementation detail.
